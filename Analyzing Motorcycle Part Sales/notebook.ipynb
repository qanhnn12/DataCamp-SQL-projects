They offer a variety of parts and accept credit card, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.\n\nThe board of directors want to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line, grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only `\"Wholesale\"` orders are included.\n\nThey have provided you with access to their database, which contains the following table called `sales`:\n\n| Column | Data type | Description |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| `order_number` | `VARCHAR` | Unique order number. |\n| `date` | `DATE` | Date of the order, from June to August 2021. |\n| `warehouse` | `VARCHAR` | The warehouse that the order was made from&mdash; `North`, `Central`, or `West`. |\n| `client_type` | `VARCHAR` | Whether the order was `Retail` or `Wholesale`. |\n| `product_line` | `VARCHAR` | Type of product ordered. |\n| `quantity` | `INT` | Number of products ordered. | \n| `unit_price` | `FLOAT` | Price per product (dollars). |\n| `total` | `FLOAT` | Total price of the order (dollars). |\n| `payment` | `VARCHAR` | Payment method&mdash;`Credit card`, `Transfer`, or `Cash`. |\n| `payment_fee` | `FLOAT` | Percentage of `total` charged as a result of the `payment` method. |\n\n\nYour query output should be presented in the following format:\n\n| `product_line` | `month` | `warehouse` |\t`net_revenue` |\n|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_one | --- | --- | --- |\n| product_two | --- | --- | --- |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"13335817","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**1.
